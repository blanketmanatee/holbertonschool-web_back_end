### Cache Replacement Policies

## FIFO
Aka 'Round Robin' When the cache is full it replacies the first page in the cache with the desired page. First in first out. 

## LIFO
Opposite of FIFO, in this policy the last added page is the first page to be removed.

## LRU
Least Recently Used replaces the item that was unused for the longest time. 

## MRU
Most Recently Used replaces the item that was most recently used first.

## LFU
Least Frequently Used counts how many times an item has been accessed and remove the item with the least.
